put button into the ravine of the breadboard.
connect a pin of the button to the positive rail with a jumper wire
connect the diagonal pin of the button to the anode (longer leg) of the LED with a jumper wire
connect one end of a resistor with the shorter end of the LED and another end to the negative rail

current flows from
positive rail --> a pin of the button --> the diagonal pin of the button --> LED --> resistor --> negative rail. Loop is closed.
When the button is pressed, two diagonal pins are connected.
